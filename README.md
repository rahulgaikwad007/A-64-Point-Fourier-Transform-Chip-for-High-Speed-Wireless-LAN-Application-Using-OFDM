# A-64-Point-Fourier-Transform-Chip-for-High-Speed-Wireless-LAN-Application-Using-OFDM
This is Mini project aiming to design a 64-Point Fourier Transform Chip for High-Speed Wireless LAN Application Using OFDM

Fifth generation wireless and mobile systems are currently the focus of research and
development. Broadband wireless systems based on orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) will allow packet- based high-data-rate communication suitable
for video transmission and mobile Internet applications. The IEEE 802.11a standard
defines the principal functions and architecture of such a high-data-rate
communication system. Apart from the high speed of operation, the system demands
low power consumption since it is primarily aimed at portable and mobile
applications. A general purpose DSP with associated software is not beneficial for this
application since on average, the power consumption of a software solution is an
order of magnitude higher compared to a functionally equivalent dedicated hardware
solution. Considering this fact we proposed a data path architecture using dedicated
hardware for the base band processor of the above- mentioned standard. We also
showed through extensive simulation that the most computationally intensive parts of
such a high-data-rate system are the 64-point inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) in
the transmit direction and the Viterbi decoder in the receive direction. Accordingly, an
appropriate design methodology for constructing them has to be chosen. For a given
functional specification, the main design concerns are:
1) how much silicon area is needed;
2) how easily the particular architecture can be made flat for
implementation in VLSI (routability);
3) in actual implementation how many wire crossings and how many
long wires carrying signals to remote parts of the design are necessary
(interconnect delay). 4) how small the power consumption can be. Extensive simulation of different algorithms and algorithm to-architecture mapping
quality exploration is necessary to choose the best algorithm for a
